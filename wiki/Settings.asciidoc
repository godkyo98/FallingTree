== Intro

Here I'll try to explain in a bit more details what are the different settings you'll find in FallingTree and when possible give some examples, so it's clearer.

There's several sections that you'll find in the configuration file or in the config GUI:

* link:Settings---General[General]
* link:Settings---Trees[Trees]
* link:Settings---Tools[Tools]
* link:Settings---Player[Player]
* link:Settings---Enchantment[Enchantment]

Examples of full config files can be found link:Settings---Examples[here].

== Server

You have several options :

* Edit the config file in the config directory.
* Edit the configuration through the GUI on a client and upload the updated configuration file to the server.

== GUI

WARNING: This method is only supported in both Fabric and Forge in 1.16.4+ releases.

The config GUI offers you an easier way to edit the configuration.
Instead of going into the configuration files and edit them manually, just navigate through an in-game menu.

This GUI isn't activated by default and need a dependency for that.

=== NeoForge/Forge

You'll need to install the dependency https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config[Cloth Config API] if available.
When it is installed alongside FallingTree, you'll be able to go into `Main menu > Mods > FallingTree > Config`.

=== Fabric

You'll need 2 dependencies :

- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu[Mod Menu].
- https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/cloth-config[Cloth Config API].

When they are installed alongside FallingTree, you'll be able to go inside `Mods > FallingTree > Config`.
